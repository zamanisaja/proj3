## Getting and Cleaning Data
Codes for solving the final project for the course: [Getting and cleaning data](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning).

### Instructions
The file Codebook.md cnotains the procedure and description of how the code works.
In the first part it just checks if the data is already downloaded and if not, it downloads it.

Then I load the train data into a dataframe called df_features_train.
and the test data into a dataframe called df_features_test.
I repeat the same for activity labels and subject list.
Then I set the column names of the dataframes.
Then I merge the two dataframes using rbind command.
```
df <- rbind(df_features_train, df_features_test)
```

now with the grep command i look for the mean and standard deviation in the column names of dataframe df and subset the dataframe accordingly.

In part 3 I've added the labeled datas to the dataframe df.
and named each activity column with the activity name.

```
levels(df$activity) <- activities
```

Then I check if there are any missing values and drop them if needed.

```
df <- na.omit(df)
```

In the 4th part I rename the names and give them more descriptive names.

In the last part I group the dataframe by subject and activity and calculate their mean. 

And finally I save the dataframe to a text file.
